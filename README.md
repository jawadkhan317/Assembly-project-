Atari Breakout is a classic arcade game developed and published by Atari Inc. in 1976. The game involves a player controlling a paddle at the bottom of the screen and using it to bounce a ball against a wall of bricks at the top of the screen. The objective is to break all the bricks while preventing the ball from falling off the bottom of the screen.

The original game was played on a single player mode, but variations have been developed with multiple players. Atari Breakout is considered a classic game and has been re-released on multiple platforms, including as a Google Easter Egg where users can play the game on the search results page by typing "Atari Breakout" into the search bar.
